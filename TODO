3D collisions:
    - https://www.peroxide.dk/papers/collision/collision.pdf
    - Above is an (older) write up on collisions using vector-space calculations. This is relevant for D3D and OpenGL
    - Implement collisions using information from the level txt file, and implement collision for the player "body"/camera

ImGui:
    - Implement saving settings, docking layout, etc to the ini file correctly, and allow it to also be loaded
    - Implement a "preferences" menu, and saving the preferences, for font, font size, text color, etc.


Level Editor:
    - using the ImGui integration, implement a "level editor" that can save the vertex, and texcoord, data to a specified .txt file,
        so that it can be used by LevelLoader afterwards.
    - this can be done either using the "editor" window, or by creating a separate application. (Preferrably integrated with the editor)


LevelLoader:
    (?)- Find a way to rework things to allow for non-euclidean geometry or rendering.


Other:
    - Migrate over to Cmake, and set up Cmake files that wwill download dependencies, and work platform agnostically.
