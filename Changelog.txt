Changelog for GLEngine changes and modifications.
Some changes may not line directly up with the date a commit, but tracking them in a file sounded like a good idea.


8/20/2025
=======================================================================================
- Implemented Dear ImGui (docking) to an initial state. This currently includes a basic Editor window,
    and some additional panes, that can be docked using the "DockSpace" functionality of Dear ImGui.
- Additionally a menu bar was also added, and will later house many typical engine features, like saving,
    importing, preferences, window options, etc.
- Reworked the Input management, Framebuffer and Dear ImGui integration to all be their own Singletons.
