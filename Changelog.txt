============================================================
+ General restructuring of the engine from it's previous version is finished.
+ This is now the new baseline/foundation for the engine going forward.

++ Engine now tentatively renamed to be the "Interloper Engine".
    This change lines up with the project name for the game I'm beginning in this engine.
